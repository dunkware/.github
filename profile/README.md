## About 

At **Dunkware**, our vision is to create better, easier computing paradigms that simplify complex processes and make them more accessible. Our focus is on innovating within the realm of IoT and real-time data streams, where powerful computing logic is applied to transform raw data into actionable intelligence. We aim to develop solutions that let users model time series data in a way similar to column-based spreadsheets but on a vastly larger and more dynamic scale. Our technology creates a foundation for high-frequency data processing and modeling, designed for the modern data-driven enterprise.

### Core Technologies

#### 1. Time Streams (Proof of Concept/Beta)
Our primary technology, currently in the Proof of Concept or Beta phase, is known as **Time Streams**. Time Streams represents a unique approach to processing and understanding time series data:

- **Data Modeling**: Rather than applying formulas to individual cells, as in a spreadsheet, Time Streams applies expressions to entire columns. This approach allows users to model real-time data with various transformations, aggregations, and historical analysis.
- **Powerful Data Processing**: Each column can reference current and historical values, enabling dynamic computations and aggregations across large datasets. In real-time, these data flows are managed through a distributed memory cache to provide rapid access and high scalability.
- **Application in Capital Markets**: Time Streams is already running in a private data center, where it computes and analyzes capital markets data. This system has the ability to generate breakout signals with multi-day perspectives, feeding into additional models for predictive and analytical purposes.

#### 2. Dunkware Street
Building upon the data generated by Time Streams, **Dunkware Street** is a secondary code base that integrates with brokerage accounts to facilitate automated trading and real-time market insights:

- **Extensible Data Models**: Models in Dunkware Street are scripted in a custom language that references signals and logic derived from Time Streams, allowing for sophisticated trade strategies based on live data.
- **Automated Trading Platform**: Dunkware Street includes both a JavaFX front-end application and a back-end server to support 24/7 automated trading, with full integration into brokerage systems.

#### 3. Cloud Parts (Go-to-Market Platform)
**Cloud Parts** is the future of Dunkware's technology, currently under design. It is envisioned as a cloud-based platform that translates the core concepts of Time Streams to a broader range of applications. 

- **Cross-Connected Cloud Containers**: The platform will enable users to define "cloud parts" — modular units of data processing that represent specific entity types or business domains. Each cloud part will leverage Dunkware’s foundational AI and data generation capabilities.
- **Integrated Intelligence**: Cloud Parts will allow users to link data generation and intelligence workflows across the cloud, creating a dynamic crossroads of data integration, business intelligence, and high-performance analytics.

### Our Patent: Declarative Control of Streaming Data
Dunkware's commitment to innovation is exemplified in our patented technology, **Declarative Control of Streaming Data** ([US11457052B1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11457052B1/en?assignee=dunkware&oq=dunkware)).

This patent outlines Dunkware's unique approach to defining and managing complex streaming data processes through declarative controls, enabling highly flexible and scalable data operations. By allowing expressions to control streaming data at the column level, Dunkware’s approach simplifies the generation of new insights from real-time data streams, creating powerful opportunities for applications across capital markets, IoT, and beyond.

### Future Directions
As Dunkware continues to evolve, our focus will be on refining Time Streams and Dunkware Street while bringing **Cloud Parts** to market. We are actively exploring funding opportunities and partnerships to expand the capabilities of our platform and deliver cutting-edge solutions for real-time data processing and cloud intelligence.
