## Concept-Driven Cloud Computing & Runtime Logic Platforms  

I’ve been deeply involved in **concept-driven cloud computing**, focusing on **higher-level computing logic** that abstracts traditional code into a **runtime execution model**. The vision is to enable **logic-first computing platforms**, where enterprise software evolves beyond static applications into dynamic, scalable runtime environments.  

Over the past year, I’ve been developing a **proof of concept** in **private repositories**, demonstrating how **complex streaming data logic** can be efficiently modeled and executed within a **tightly coupled computing cluster**. This approach significantly improves **speed and flexibility** compared to traditional solutions, making data modeling and real-time processing more intuitive and scalable.
