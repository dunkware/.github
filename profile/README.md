### Transformations in Cloud Computing: Introducing Dunkware Alpha

Dunkware has taught me something profound: **transformations happen, and when they do, they feel almost instantaneous.** It’s a stark contrast to the years of effort, relentless problem-solving, and occasional self-doubt it took to reach this moment. Today, I’m thrilled to share that all that hard work—and, yes, even the moments of self-torture—has finally paid off.

The formation of processes that took place over many years for Dunkware was an evolutionary path that has created a technology positioned at the perfect intersection of **shifting cloud economics** and the growing frustration with **cloud costs and provider lock-in**. At its core, Dunkware is a “logic-first cloud” platform, a concept I’ve coined to describe a computing cloud driven by the user’s ability to create, extend, test, and deploy their own logic into the cloud. This is a fresh perspective—quite different from what the industry is currently focused on. Watching from the front-row seats of the cloud revolution, I see an opportunity to offer a **better, simplified way of building cool things in the cloud.** That’s where Dunkware stands today.

### Rethinking Cloud Computing

To dive into the geeky stuff: **Dunkware is not a managed cloud service**—at least not yet. What Dunkware represents is a shift towards **portable cloud computing.** I firmly believe that our industry, with Dunkware being one small part of it, will force cloud providers like AWS into a commodity. It’s hard to believe that so many technology leaders today find it acceptable to rely on provider-specific functionality that prevents **portable cloud infrastructure.** Dunkware challenges this approach by prioritizing portability.

Dunkware is built to run entirely on **open-source Kubernetes**, allowing the “Dunkware Cloud” to be deployed by customers into their own public cloud accounts at AWS or Microsoft Azure. Importantly, it operates **independently** of the proprietary services provided by these platforms, except for the Kubernetes service itself. This approach ensures that users maintain full control of their infrastructure, free from vendor lock-in.

### Dunkware Pilot: A Stable Foundation

Currently, Dunkware Pilot, our stable build, is running in our own data center. This allows us to **scale up and scale down** as needed, providing a flexible foundation for growth. What’s exciting is the growing group of friends, collaborators, and thinkers who are evolving this technology alongside me. Together, we’re shaping Dunkware into something that challenges conventional cloud thinking and brings new possibilities to life.

It’s time to move into this next stage. Dunkware is now entering real-world environments with people who can challenge me and guide me in presenting this vision in ways that resonate with their unique needs. Whether it’s **complex backtesting**, operational optimization, or something entirely unexpected, I’m eager to explore what’s possible.

### A Journey of Evolution

After years of effort, the other side of this journey feels like the beginning of a whole new chapter. My thoughts on what Dunkware can do are clear, but this stage is about bringing in **more thoughts, more ideas, and more collaboration.** That’s why I’m excited to announce the next steps for Dunkware and invite others to be part of this evolution. Let’s build something transformative, together.
