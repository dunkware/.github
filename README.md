# ☁️ **Dunkware: Concept-Driven Cloud Computing**  

Dunkware explores **new abstractions in cloud computing**, combining **concept modeling, Kubernetes-based orchestration, and Spring Boot extensions** to redefine how applications are built and deployed.

**Ideas & Initiatives**  
- **Concept Cloud** – A new way to model and compute in the cloud.  
- **Stream Processing** – Turning real-time data into actionable insights.  
- **Kubernetes Abstractions** – Operators and scalable workloads made simple.  
- **Spring Boot Extensions** – Modular, pluggable components for cloud applications.  
- **Composable Logic** – Defining software as reusable, declarative parts.  

Managed by **Duncan Krebs (krebznet)**.
